# Learn_Python
In this directory we learn Python through programs/ problems / 
projects...lets start :)

1. Generate random password for users :-
To create a password with Python, we need to create a program that takes the length of the password and generates a random password of the same length.

2. Play Rock, Paper and Scissors :- 
To create the Rock, Paper and Scissors game with Python, we need to take the userâ€™s choice and then we need to compare it with the computer choice which is taken using the random module in Python from a list of choices.
